The codes for baseline in the paper are uploaded!

### Competition

We are also organizing a competition based on our ChID dataset, and [here](https://biendata.com/competition/idiom/) is the website. The adapted corpus establishes up connections between blanks, and adopts a new type of problem. A list of passages (not an isolated one) is provided and the answers need to be selected from a given set of candidate idioms with fixed length (for more details, please refer to the competition website). The public data contains the training data (both the passages with blanks and the golden answers), the development data (only the passages, and the answers will be available later) and the corpus of idiom explanations.

The baselines of the competition are [Attentive Reader](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03340) and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).

The data and baseline codes for the competition will be uploaded later.
